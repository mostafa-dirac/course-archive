These are the assignment of [CE 424: Operating Systems](http://sharif.edu/~kharrazi/courses/40424-982/).

1. First Project: Implementing [Threads](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/fa15/static/projects/project1.pdf)
2. Second Project: Implementing [User programs](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/fa15/static/projects/project2.pdf)
3. Third Project: Implementing [File System](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/fa15/static/projects/project3.pdf)

Unfortunately, we couldn't accomplish the third project and we did it by 70%.
