# Notable Bachelor Programming Assignments

I also have wrote many lines of MATLAB code but I think that they are not worthwhile since they are for really specific topics.

1. [PintOS](./PintOS/): This is my entry gate to the operating systems world. I loved this project. This is adopted from [Berkeley CS162](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS162/group0) group projects. Thanks to my teammates: Matin Khajavai, Arezou Pakzad, and Shabnam Sheikhha. This is the group project in the [Operating Systems](http://sharif.edu/~kharrazi/courses/40424-982/) course, Fall 2018.
2. [OS](./operating-system/): These are the indivisual assignments in the [Operating Systems](http://sharif.edu/~kharrazi/courses/40424-982/) course, Fall 2018.
3. [Computer Networks](./computer-networks/): These are indivisual assignments in the [Computer Networks](http://sharif.edu/~kharrazi/courses/40443-972/) course, Spring 2019.
